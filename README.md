An R package to calculate the Green-Ampt infiltration under unsteady rainfall
conditions. Mein and Larsen (1973) and Chu (1988) adopted the original Green and Ampt (1911) and developed alogrithms to calculate infiltration under steady and unsteady rainfall with both ponded and non-nonponded conditions.
This package is largely based on the fortran program 'wingampt' developed by Carpena and Parsons (2009), Version 0.3 which can be obtained in the following address.
