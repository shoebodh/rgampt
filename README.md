An R package to calculate the Green-Ampt infiltration under unsteady rainfall
conditions.
  Mein and Larsen (1973) and Chu (1988) adopted the original Green and Ampt (1911)    infiltration equation and updated it to estimate infiltration under
  steady and unsteady rainfall with bot ponded and non-nonponded conditions.

This package is largely based on the fortran program 'wingampt' developed by Carpen and Parsons (2009, Version 0.3).Which can be obtained in this address.
